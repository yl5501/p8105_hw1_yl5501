## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Problem 1

install.packages("palmerpenguins")
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

```{r}
view(penguins)
```

```{r}
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
```


```{r}
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```


## Description
There are 344 observations of 8 variables in the penguins dataset, displayed by 8 columns and 344 rows.

The 8 variables are
- species (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstra)
- island (Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream)
- bill_length_mm (value for bill length in mm)
- bill_depth_mm (value for bill depth in mm )
- flipper_length_mm (value for flipper length in mm)
- body_mass_g (value for body mass in grams)
- sex (male/female)
- year (2007/2008/2009)

The mean flipper length is 200.9152 


## Including Plots
install.packages("ggplot2")
library (ggplot2)

```{r}
penguins_clean <- na.omit(penguins)

ggplot(penguins_clean, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length",
    x = "Bill Length (mm)",
    y = "Flipper Length (mm)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
ggsave("scatterplot_penguins.png")


## Problem 2
library(tidyverse)

# Create a data frame
```{r}
set.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility
df <- tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),  # Random sample from standard normal distribution
  logical_vector = rnorm(10) > 0,  # Logical vector indicating if values > 0
  character_vector = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),  # Character vector
  factor_vector = factor(rep(c("level1", "level2", "level3"), length.out = 10))  # Factor vector
)
```

```{r}
df
```

```{r}
mean_random_sample <- mean(df$random_sample)
mean_logical_vector <- mean(df$logical_vector)
mean_character_vector <- try(mean(df$character_vector), silent = TRUE)  # Use try to handle error
mean_factor_vector <- try(mean(df$factor_vector), silent = TRUE)

mean_random_sample
mean_logical_vector
mean_character_vector
mean_factor_vector
```
## What works and what doesn't?
mean_random_sample and mean_logical_vector worked.
mean_character_vector and mean_factor_vector didn't work.


## Use as.numeric to convert variables from one type to another
```{r}
as.numeric(df$logical_vector)
```

```{r}
as.numeric(df$character_vector)
```

```{r}
as.numeric(df$factor_vector)
```
